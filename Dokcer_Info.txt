# Docker Networks:

    CASE I: If we have two seperate containers one is for django app and another is for mysql database 
            now we can not able to connect those containers because they can not communicate with each other
            so for that we need to create one network and add "--network < networkName>" this flag while running
            those containers seperatly and also do one change just replace container name with MY_SQL_HOST="Conainer_Name"

            eg. docker run < imgName> --network < netName> / 
    
    But if we use docker-compose it will create network automatically
    
    Types of Networks:
        1. Host
        2. Bridge (Default)
        3. User Defined Bridge (Custom)
        4. None

        5. MACVLAN (docker swarm)
        6. IPVLAN (docker swarm)
        7. Overlay (docker swarm)


# Docker Volumes and Storage

1. Named Volume: We create a volume and then mount it with conatainer

    -v volumeName: /var/lib/mysql == Now you can mount volume with container while runnig container 
    we can just add the above flag with docker run cmd

2. Path Volume: We create a folder and just mount it's path with container

    -v /home/ubuntu/my_folder/: /var/lib/mysql == Now you will get all data backup inside given folder

So the above two ways to mount docker volumes with container

# Docker Compose

We can create and manage multiple container with single config file

# Multi stage docker build

Generally, in docker file we used base image eg. we use python 3.8 base img to build the app but it is not usefull
to run the application it is just usefull to install (requiremts.txt) packages so what we do, we slim base image
to run the project

# Docker Scout

It is tool which will scan images and check vulnerabilities of that image, this tool is available inside docker 
desktop

# Docker init

It will create DockerFile docker-compose README.Docker.md for us answering simple questions
