Docker Networks:

    CASE I: If we have two seperate containers one is for django app and another is for mysql database 
            now we can not able to connect those containers because they can not communicate with each other
            so for that we need to create one network and add "--network < networkName>" this flag while running
            those containers seperatly and also do one change just replace container name with MY_SQL_HOST="Conainer_Name"

            eg. docker run < imgName> --network < netName> / 
    
    But if we use docker-compose it will create network automatically
    
    Types of Networks:
        1. Host
        2. Bridge (Default)
        3. User Defined Bridge (Custom)
        4. None

        5. MACVLAN (docker swarm)
        6. IPVLAN (docker swarm)
        7. Overlay (docker swarm)
